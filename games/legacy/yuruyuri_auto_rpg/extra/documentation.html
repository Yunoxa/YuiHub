    <h2>The UI</h2>
      
      <h10>Panels</h10><br>
      Currently, there are four characters in this game. Yui, Akari, Kyoko, and Chinatsu. Each of them have their own character panel. <img style = "float:left; border-radius: 0%;" height = "400px" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7fab6675-f510-4e24-ba3a-415210525540%2Ffirefox_L6P6GA8VPI.png?v=1617878240032"> <br>
      An example of a character panel can be seen on the left. Each character panel will contain all of the information that is available for the character. You may scroll up and down the character panel with the scrollbar in order to view everything. <br>
      "General Info" displays general information such as the characters location and current activity.<br>
      "Class Info" displays class information such as the characters abilities or effects.<br>
      "Fighting Stats" provides stats and information about the characters fighting. <br>
      "Mining Stats" provides stats and information about the characters mining. <br>
      "Store Stats" provides stats and information about the characters shopping, next upgrades, and their inventory. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
      <h10>The Log</h10><br>
      Every single event that happens is logged here. It is useful for viewing what characters are doing in real time, or for checking over previous things characters have done in the session. As with character panels, you may navigate up and down the log by using the scroll bar on the right. The latest events appear at the bottom so be sure to scroll down in order to see what is happening most recently. <img width = "1000px" style = "border-radius: 0%;" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/7fab6675-f510-4e24-ba3a-415210525540%2Fe9d62380-5131-4af5-a9b2-530d318e3a2d.image.png?v=1617883374771"> <br>
      <h1>Power number</h1><br>
      Beside the names of characters and enemies you should see a number surrounded by brackets e.g (15). This number shows the total power of that character or enemy during their battle. <br>
      <br>

Clicking the save button will save the all current information of your characters, however the log will not be saved and will reset on reloading the page. If you click load then the character data that is currently saved will be loaded. A successful save or load should send a message in the log.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    Activities are randomly chosen every few minutes and decide what the character will be doing during the time they are active. All characters start out fighting, but after that their activities are totally randomised. <br>
    <br>
    <h10>Fighting</h10> <br>
    <br>
    Fighting is an activity where the character fights enemies in a dungeon. It gives a large amount of XP and a small amount of money.
    <h1>Dungeons</h1>
    There are multiple dungeons in this game. All characters start out in the "Undead Corridor" dungeon. In order to progress to more rewarding dungeons the character must earn money and buy dungeon keys. The better the characters dungeon key, the better the dungeons they can go to.
    Higher level dungeons will provide higher value drops from enemies, and enemies will provide far more XP (although they will be stronger).<br>
    Dungeons also have their own unique AI generated images to add some visuals.
    <h1>Power</h1>
    In order to defeat an enemy, the character must have a higher power and weapon damage than the enemies power. On a failed attempt to defeat an enemy, the character will gain only 1 XP. On a successful defeat, the character will gain more XP, and has a chance of receiving a drop from the enemy which can be sold in the shop.
    <h1>XP</h1>
    Once XP reaches the required amount, the character will level up and the XP will reset, with the required amount for the next level increasing.
    <h1>Levels</h1>
    On every level up, the characters power will be increased and the amount of money they sell drops for will have a slight increase.
    <h1>Enemies</h1>
    Enemies are tagged with different classes. More powerful classes have a higher base power and base XP reward. The level of an enemy will be from 1 to the level of the character fighting them + 2.<br>
    Here are the Enemy classes in order of their base power and XP rewards:<br>
    - [Weak]<br>
    - [Normal]<br>
    - [Tough]<br>
    - [Elite]<br>
    - [Boss]<br>
    <br>
    Some enemies may also come equipped with a [Bully] type tag. These tags increase the enemies power, but don't increase reward unless defeated by a Ranger. Rangers can also perform rescue missions on entities being bullied by such enemies, providing money.<br>
    If a group of enemies is killed at once, all the kills will be condensed into a single log message. (e.g "Yui defeated a team of 2 enemies." or "Akari failed to defeat an army of 5530 enemies.")
    <h1>Weapons</h1>
    Weapons are earned as random drops from enemies. All characters will start out with a basic weapon with no modifiers. Characters will only equip a weapon they find if the found weapons "Weapon Rating" exceeds that of their current weapon.<br>
    Here is a list of weapon parameters:<br>
    - Weapon Damage: The total damage of the weapon.<br>
    - Weapon Kill Multiplier: The total amount of attacks this weapon can do at once.<br>
    - Weapon Rating: The total strength of the weapon.<br>
    <br>
    Weapons currently have 4 modifiers which decide the total damage of the weapon:<br>
    - Level: A randomly generated level for the weapon. It is a number between 1 and the level of the character getting the weapon.<br>
    - Material: Material is selected based on the level. The higher the weapons level, the better the material it will have. Better materials provide higher multipliers for calculating weapon damage.<br>
    - Quality: The quality of the weapon is randomly decided, with higher qualities being rarer, and lower or more average qualities being the most common. Better qualities provide higher multipliers for calculating weapon damage.<br>
    - Power Type: This is the coloured tag at the start of the weapon name. It is randomly generated, with higher power types being far more rare. Better Power Types provide higher multipliers for calculating weapon damage.<br>
    <br>
    Here is a list of current weapon Power types, from best to worst:<br>
    - [GOD INFUSED]<br>
    - [BLESSED]<br>
    - [ULTIMATE]<br>
    - [ELITE]<br>
    - [ULTRA STRONG]<br>
    - [STRONG]<br>
    - [TOUGH]<br>
    - [NORMAL]<br>
    - [WEAK]<br>
    <br>
    Here is a list of current weapon Qualities, from best to worst:<br>
    - Perfect Quality<br>
    - Exceptional Quality<br>
    - Brilliant Quality<br>
    - Amazing Quality<br>
    - Very good Quality<br>
    - Great Quality<br>
    - Good Quality<br>
    - Decent Quality<br>
    - Average Quality<br>
    - Poor Quality<br>
    - Worn<br>
    - Damaged<br>
    - Broken<br>
    <br>
    A weapons damage is calculated as: WeaponBaseDamage + WeaponLevel * (MaterialMultiplier * QualityMultiplier * PowerTypeMultiplier) <br>
    A weapons Kill Multiplier is increased by 1 every 50 weapon levels. <br>
    A weapons rating is calculated as: WeaponDamage * WeaponKillMultiplier<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h10>Mining</h10> <br>
    <br>
    Mining is an activity where the character goes to the "Endless Mine" and mines items to be sold for money. The character earns good money from this activity.
    <h1>Pickaxe</h1>
    Each character will begin with a stone pickaxe, which is able to mine rocks. When the character earns enough money, they can buy better pickaxes at the shop which provide them with the ability to mine more valuable items. Each pickaxe will only mine any ores minable from previous pickaxes, plus a new one which has more value than the previous.
    <h1>Ores</h1>
    When something is mined, it is added to the inventory so that it can be sold. The ore mined depends on what pickaxe the character has. <br>
    <h1>Mining level</h1>
    When enough ores are mined, the mining level will increase. Higher mining level increases the sell price of ores. <br>
    <br>
    <h10>Shopping</h10> <br>
    <br>
    Shopping is where the character sells items in their inventory and buys new tools such as pickaxes if they can afford them. Once they are done they automatically switch to a different activity.
    <h1>Inventory</h1>
    All of the characters items that they have gathered are stored in the inventory. All the items stored here are for selling once they go to the store.
    <h1>Selling</h1>
    Once the character is shopping, they will sell all of the items in their inventory at once.
    <h1>Buying</h1>
    Once the character is shopping, they will buy anything they can afford with their current money, such as new pickaxes.
    <h1>Money</h1>
    Money is earned through selling items from the inventory. It can be used to purchase new tools.
